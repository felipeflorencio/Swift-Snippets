	/* Helper to have a delay to a specif need
	   It's happen for different reason's, some good some not that good, but, you need delay a operation
	   for this we have different approachs, but it's with this helper you will be able to do this in a
	   clean and easy way, and extend NSObject, so you can easy use this, or event implement in your class

	   How to use:

	   Just need to be inside any NSObject class type, and do like
	   self.delayOperation(delay: seconds, closure: {
	   		// Do the action that you intend too.
	   })

	   But, as I said, only to NSObject class, but for struct you just need to implement the protocol :D
